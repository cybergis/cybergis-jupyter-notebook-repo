In starting from a general problem outline, without a base of code to build on, we created a wonderfully functional example of collaborative, CyberGIS-enabed research. Given our mix of academic and domain experience, we've ensured shared communication, linked goals, and accelerated each other towards solving our problem. With three members with stronger coding experience (Yuqin, David, Jinwoo), and three members with stronger theoretical background (Forrest, Xuan, and Alex), we've built a web of interaction to advance our analysis. For example, group discussions on the nature of R&R have helped inform the structure of the code and interface. By creating a space for discussion and collaboration, we've been able to construct a unified final product."
